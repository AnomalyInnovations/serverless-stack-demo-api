# Serverless Stack Extended Backend Resources

[Serverless Stack](https://serverless-stack.com) is a free comprehensive guide to creating full-stack serverless applications. We create a [note taking app](https://demo2.serverless-stack.com) from scratch.

This repo is used in the [Best Practices section](https://serverless-stack.com/chapters/best-practices-for-building-serverless-apps.html) of the guide.
